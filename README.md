# Birdman
## Description
Build a `dropdown` menu using a `click` event and `.toggle()` animation method.

## Objective
Birdman wants to add a dropdown menu to their home page. [Here's what it looks like]("https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/2/birdman/index.html"). Click on the menu icon ![menu](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/2/birdman/menu.svg) at the top left to alternate showing and hiding the dropdown menu.

## Tasks
### 1.
Look at __index.html__. In the `<div class="dropdown">` section, there are two elements: an `<img>` element and a `<ul class="dropdown-menu">` element. When the `<img>` is clicked, we want the `<ul class="dropdown-menu">` element to appear.

### 2.
In __app.js__, attach an event handler to the `<img>` element so that it can respond to a click event.

### 3.
Inside the `click` event handler, `toggle` the `<ul class="dropdown-menu">` element.

### 4.
In __index.html__, add text for more list items in the dropdown menu. We used for Tools, Blog, Careers, About, and Contact. Feel free to use your own.
